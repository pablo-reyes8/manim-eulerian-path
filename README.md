Bring graph theory to life with an elegant, Manim-powered visualization of Eulerian traversals. Ideal for educators, students, and anyone curious about how Hierholzer’s algorithm systematically uncovers a circuit that uses every edge exactly once.

## Introduction

An **Eulerian circuit** is a closed path in which every edge of a connected graph is visited exactly one time. This tool generates random undirected graphs, verifies Eulerian conditions, and then animates the step-by-step process of Hierholzer’s algorithm—highlighting edge selection, backtracking, and the merging of cycles into a complete tour.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Graph Generation**  
  Create diverse, connected graphs with tunable node counts and edge probabilities—always ensuring no isolated vertices.

- **Automatic Verification**  
  Instantly check connectivity and vertex degrees to determine if an Eulerian path or circuit exists.

- **Hierholzer’s Algorithm in Action**  
  Explore how local cycles are discovered and spliced together into a global circuit, with clear visual cues for each decision point.

- **High-Quality Animations**  
  Smooth, frame-accurate rendering that illuminates traversal order, backtracking moments, and final circuit closure.

- **Notebook-Friendly**  
  Designed to integrate seamlessly into interactive environments, enabling rapid experimentation with different graphs and random seeds.

## Customization

- **Graph Topology**: Adjust parameters to generate sparse or dense networks and observe how structure impacts circuit complexity.  
- **Visual Style**: Tailor colors, node sizes, and animation pacing to suit presentations or personal preference.  
- **Performance Tuning**: Control frame rates and rendering settings for faster previews or polished video output.
